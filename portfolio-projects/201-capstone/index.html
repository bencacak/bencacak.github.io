                        <h2>Artist's Statement</h2>
                       
                        <p>&emsp;As a requirement per my Digital Technology and Culture 201 class at Washington State University with Brenda Grell as a professor, I am completing a capstone project to demonstrate my new found skills over the course. As an outlet for the project, I am tackling the issue of heteronormativity, a pervasive ideology turned into practice in the hegemonic culture of the United States. With this project, I hope to inform my audiences of this ideology that is practiced every day, as well as give them tools to help combat the social issue itself.</p>
                       
                       <p>&emsp;For the first media object in this project, I have created a two minute and 12 second remixed video. To create the video, I remixed several videos, which all explain, define, and address heteronormative values that are instilled in western culture. I juxtaposed the videos discussing heteronormativity with common Disney films viewed by many children annually.</p>
             
                       <p>&emsp;The second media object that I have created (WIP) is an 800 pixel by 1200 pixel vectored image created in adobe illustrator to form an infographic. This infographic is comprised of two parts: a rationale to the discourses viewed in the video and three steps that my audiences can take to combat and challenge heteronormativity themselves.</p>
             
                       <p>&emsp;I hope that this project both challenges the preconceived notions that my audiences may have held, as well as inspires than to take social justice in their own hands by challenging the status quo.</p>
