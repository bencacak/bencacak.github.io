                <h2>My name is Ben.</h2>
                <h3>About myself:</h3>
                <p>Hello. My name is Ben. I am a web developer, life-long learner, and triathlete. I've been building basic websites since high school. As a freshman, I registered for a class called Web Publishing, where I learned the fundamentals of HTML. The curriculum covered Adobe Flash, but no CSS. The websites I built using Microsoft Notepad on a school computer featured neon text on top of black backgrounds. Styling was entirely inline and frequently just the browser default. Despite its limited depth, that class gave me a foundation for my future dives into programming.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A better part of a decade later, during my first year at Washington State University, I took a course called Multimedia Authoring&mdash;DTC 355 for short.I consider this my <em>serious</em> introduction to web development and programming. It was an introduction to web development with a distinct focus on UI, UX, theming, and design. Though I already knew the basics of HTML, I was still humbled. I had no previous experience working with CSS, nor had I any training in making aesthetically-pleasing webpages that were also intuitive for users to interact with. I loved the challenge, so the following year I took an introductory JavaScript and jQuery course with the same instructor. It was an objectively challenging course for me, but I walked away with a much broader knowledge of programming and web design. However, I felt that my future lay elsewhere, so I pursued other passions.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Recently, I decided to revist web development as a career path. Some time has passed since I took the two web development classes at university, so to combat the lapse in my skills in that time, I have been reviewing and relearning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on Codecademy. I'm pleased by how much I've retained since college, and I've enjoyed brushing up on how to write clean and efficient code. I have even learned Bash, Git, and how to use GitHub as a content management system. Currently, I'm learning React.js and Redux to round out my frontend skills.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
