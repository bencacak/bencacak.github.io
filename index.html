                <h2>My name is Ben.</h2>
                <h3>About myself:</h3>
                <p>Hello. My name is Ben. I am an aspiring web developer, life-long learner, and triathlete. I was first introduced to the world of web page development when I was in high school. In my freshman year, I registered for a class called web publishing. There I learned the fundamentals of HTML. However, the only other part of the curriculum was Adobe Flash and CSS was not a subject of class lecture. The website I built using Microsoft Notepad on the school computer frequently featured black backgrounds with neon text on top. All styles were inline and most set to their browser defaults. However, that class laid the foundation for coding and programming languages. The simple knowledge of how to nest tags properly made my transition into more formal training smoother.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A better part of the decade later, during my first year at Washington State University, I took a course called Multimedia authoring—DTC 355 for short. It was an introduction to Web Development with a distinct focus on UI and UX, theming, and design. I already knew the basics of HTML. While I do feel that gave me more confidence going into the class, I was still humbled. I had no previous experience Working with CSS3. Nor had I any training in making an aesthetically pleasing site or that is functional from a user’s perspective. I feel that I was able to be challenged in ways that I would not have thought possible. The following year, I took another course from the same instructor. This was an introduction to JavaScript and JQuery. While this was an objectively challenging course for me, I was able to walk away with a much broader knowledge of computer programming and what makes the everyday processes of web apps and interactive websites possible. At this point in my educational career, I felt that web development was not the path I wanted to chase, so I stopped working on my skills at that point.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After school, I decided that web development is the career path that I would like to take. However, a little bit of time has passed since I took the two web development classes at university. To combat the length of time, I have been reviewing and learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the Codecademy platform. While it has mostly been a jog of the memory, I am picking skills to write code more cleanly and efficiently. I have picked up BASH, Git, and how to use GitHub as a content management system. I am also planning on and interested in learning React.js and Redux as well to flush out my front-end skillset.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
